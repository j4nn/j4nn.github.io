<h3>Tools to backup Trim Area of xperia XZ1 compact</h3>
<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/xperia-xz1-compact/development/devonly-exploits-temp-root-to-backup-t3795510">thread on xda with the tools development</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Please note: I had to invest enormously lot of time to develop these tools,
the code is extremely complex (more than 9000 lines of source code)
and it was unbelievable hard to debug and get the timing usable.<br/>
It would be kind of you if you could consider donating here please:<br/>

I would be happy to accept any donation to me as a form of gratitude
in case the software helped you to backup your TA (drm keys) before
bootloader unlocking.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
